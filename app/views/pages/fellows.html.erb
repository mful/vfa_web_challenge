<h5>
Compensation and Benefits
</h5>

<p>
You will receive a full salary plus comprehensive health benefits. Fellows are fully employed by their host company and receive health benefits through their employer. Each Fellow earns a salary of between $32,000 – $38,000/year depending on their placement city. All Fellowship programs and benefits are provided at no charge to each Fellow.
</p>

<h5>
Continuing Education
</h5>

<p>
Venture For America provides a two-year curriculum so that each Fellow may continue to deepen his or her understanding of how to build a business even as he or she works. Fellows will meet at least monthly in their cities to discuss work experiences, supplementary readings, and other related topics. After the conclusion of the first year, Fellows will gather for an “Intermission”, where they will debrief about their individual experiences with their class members.
At the conclusion of the second year of their assignment, Fellows will attend a final capstone and will be eligible for $100K in seed investment from the VFA Investment Committee. This seed investment may go to support the Fellow s current company or a new enterprise that the Fellow wishes to found or co-found immediately or at a later date, at the discretion of the committee.

  </div>
<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a Venture for America Fellow and joining the movement to build businesses and create jobs throughout the country. </p>
<p>
<b>Applications to join the Class of 2013 are now closed.</b>
For our 2014 Fellowship (beginning in June 2014), you must apply before one of the following deadlines: October 7, 2013; December 2, 2013; and February 17, 2014.
</p>
<h3>WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR</h3>
<p>VFA Fellows will be selected through an application process that will include an online application, multiple interviews, case studies, and behavioral exercises. The goal will be to screen candidates for qualities that distinguish successful entrepreneurs and start-up leaders, including: </p>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Intellect and Independent Thinking</li>
<li>Determination/Ability to Surmount Obstacles/Resourcefulness</li>
<li>Technical Aptitude and/or the Ability to Develop and Learn New Skills</li>
<li>Leadership Ability/Initiative</li>
<li>Communication and Interpersonal Skills</li>
<li>Purpose-Driven/Character</li>
</ul>
<p>Our application process is designed to assess candidates' potential to add value to an early-stage company. While there are certain general qualities that speak to this potential (i.e., structured thinking, consistently high-level work product), there is no one background or profile that represents an ideal VFA Fellow. Each may have a unique record of success and achievement.</p>
<p>Some candidates demonstrate their potential through rigorous coursework and leadership in extracurricular activities, some have impressive internship experiences, some are high-level athletes, and still others have been company founders themselves. To make a strong case for your candidacy, make sure your application reflects that you: learn and adapt quickly, set high standards for your work, possess a passion for entrepreneurship, and exhibit an unparalleled work ethic.</p>
<h3>HOW TO APPLY</h3>
<h5>SELECTION PROCESS</h5>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Applicants complete an online application where they submit a resume, transcript, academic information, and short essays</li>
<li>
Selected applicants have a 30-minute phone interview with a Venture for America representative and a short video interview through
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.taketheinterview.com">TaketheInterview.com</a>
</li>
<li>The most promising applicants attend a full-day, in-person interview, which includes group problem solving activities and one-on-one interviews</li>
</ul>
<h5>APPLICATION PREREQUISITES</h5>
<b>BACHELORS DEGREE</b>
<p>You must have received your bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university before the start of the fellowship orientation program. You also must have received a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate.</p>
<h5>3.0 MINIMUM CUMULATIVE GPA</h5>
<p>You must have a cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4.00 scale (as measured by the institution awarding your degree) at the time we receive your application, as well as at the time of graduation. Graduate school GPAs should not be used or averaged in with undergraduate GPAs. If you are accepted into Venture for America and your final GPA falls below a 3.0, you will forego your position with Venture for America. Applicants must also pass any coursework indicated on their transcript as in progress at the time of their interview.</p>
<h5>US CITIZENSHIP OR NATIONAL/PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS</h5>
<p>Due to the hiring restrictions of many of our partner companies, Venture for America may only accept US citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents for admission into the program. Individuals who are in the United States under a student, work, or tourist visa are not eligible to become Venture for America fellows. Similarly, individuals who have refugee status but nothing indicating permanent resident alien status are not eligible to become Venture for America Fellows.</p>
<h5>APPLICANT DECLARATION</h5>
<p>Venture for America is looking for individuals who embody our organization's values and standards. Before submitting the application, all applicants should read and agree to the following statements:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>I see my professional pursuits and my career as a moral choice that indicates my values.</li>
<li>I appreciate those who assume personal risks in order to build a company or pursue a common good.</li>
<li>I believe that actions are the proper measure of one's accomplishments.</li>
<li>I believe that creating opportunities for myself and others is an important aspect of professional success.</li>
<li>I believe that one’s professional conduct is a reflection of personal character, and will always strive to act accordingly.</li>

Curious about the unintended consequences of grant-based funding, she interviewed non-profits across Malawi for her senior thesis to understand how they accessed funding and its effect on their relationship with government. On campus, she spearheaded the creation of "The Real Food Co-op", a student communal cooking and dining cooperative, founded "Lotus Cafe", a weekly wine-and-tea-filled dialogue for students to discuss personal and community issues, and partnered with fellow students to incite a campus-wide mental health movement. After graduation, she co-authored paper that develops a framework for understanding how different types of technology-enabled networks can be harnessed for international development. She then became a research associate at the Rockefeller Foundation.  She loves capoeira, trying new foods, and good conversation.</p>

Brentt works closely with The Posse Foundation – one of the most comprehensive and renowned college access and youth leadership development programs in the United States (www.possefoundation.org).

Brentt spends his free time hunting down original muscle car parts, as he works towards re-building a 1967 Pontiac Firebird 400. The hobby has forced him to appreciate patience and to learn to channel frustration; especially when his car breaks down on the busiest freeway in Los Angeles, because for some reason, the clutch pedal has fallen to the floor. Majoring in Economics and Finance at Claremont McKenna, Brentt had the opportunity to embark on a two-week community building trip to Honduras, living with a host family. In addition, he was Captain and MVP of the 2010 Division II National Champion Rugby team.</p>

His experiences there gave him many eye-opening experiences in rural lives and community health. These exposures paved his interests in understanding how various spheres of influence affect rural communities, from public health standpoint. The idea of information dissemination from a research institution to the general consumer is an area Johnny wants to tackle. He strongly believes information dissemination can fluidly permeate to the general public if creative modality amalgamates correctly to the information. Fascinated by the prowess of storytelling, Johnny sets out to understand this concept by creating a documentary on LGBTQ minorities and their empowerment. He hopes to finish the film before he graduates. Currently, Johnny studies Visual Arts at the University of Chicago. Johnny enjoys how fencing, photography, filmmaking, technical learning, conversations, cycling, and cheesecakes tickle his senses.</p>
